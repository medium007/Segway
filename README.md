# Segway
Segway simulation


To open the project you have to run main.py using python interpreter in console or IDE.
It is required to have Morse environment installed on your computer.
If you have files with environment done by us which are not included on GitHub you can uncomment lines in default.py, otherwise it will start witch outdoors (default environment from Morse)
If there is no joystick connected, which we were using, the segway will spin around
